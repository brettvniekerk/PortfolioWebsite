# This is the old version of my portfolio website!
This site features a couple cool ideas I iterated on for my main site - such as scroll-dependant fading, and reactive sizing.

## Tech Stack
The site was built with NextJS, React, Typescript, and SCSS.
It was deployed with Vercel, which allowed for a frictionless development experience - the automatic deployments when the codebase changed was an absolute game changer.
Source control was done through Git and GitHub using the Git CLI.

## Goal
The goal of the site was to provide an aesthetic and interesting design that would highlight my interests in bringing web pages to life - and the initial landing page achieved this goal. However, the subsequent sections did not align with my artistic vision and ultimately made the site look less professional. To mitigate this for the new site, I adopted Figma as a design platform in order to structure and plan out the new design.

## Challenges
Specific challenges involved the implementation of more advanced features, like the scroll-dependant fading of elements, and the extensive CSS used to place everything. With respect to the scroll-dependant fading, the main issue was in minimising state usage, and event listener usage. Particularly for the new site, where the scrolling would be present in multiple components, duplicating the component code that handled these features would prove inefficient.
In terms of CSS, it became very extensive and unoptimised due to a lack of proficiency with the language. With respect to the new site, my CSS has definitely improved, and resulted in cleaner, readable, and optimised code. Using CSS grids to block the layout of the site has made the process of structuring everything infinitely easier too.
